# VentToLife
The purpose was an academic project simulating Vent2Life real project and the goal was to build a website that allow a user to register to help on ventilators issues.

The website is based on Django and Python, in the backend; In the frontend I tried to play a little bit with bootstrap along with HTML and CSS.

Description:
Enter the site and register yourself as a medical staff or as a technical expertise.
Then, you have access to a forum, with a list of hospitals where it is possible to report a ventilator problem and get some help (if are smaller issues with the machine).
Basically, in the website you have information about COVID, about the website itself, about NHS information as well and support for other members.
